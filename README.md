# Dungeon Escape
 This was a game made with the help of the course Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games by GameDev.tv with the collaboration of Epic Games.
 
 Since this is a game taught in a course I wanted to maximize my learning process so I implemented small original ideas into this game and made the game longer.
